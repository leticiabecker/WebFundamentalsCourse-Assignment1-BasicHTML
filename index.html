					<h2>Sirens</h2>
					<section class="lyrics">
						<p>Hear the sirens.<br />
						Hear the sirens.</p>
						<p>Hear the sirens,<br />
						Hear the circus so profound.<br />
						I hear the sirens<br />
						More and more in this here town</p>
						<p>Let me catch my breath to breathe<br />
						And reach across the bed<br />
						Just to know we're safe<br />
						I am a grateful man</p>
						<p>The slightest bit of light<br />
						And I can see you clear<br />
						Oh, have to take your hand<br />
						And feel your breath for fear this someday will be over </p>
						<p>I pull you close, so much to lose knowing that nothing lasts forever<br />
						I didn't care before you were here.<br />
						I danced in laughter with the everafter<br />
						But all things change<br />
						Let this remain</p>
						<p>Hear the sirens<br />
						Covering distance in the night.<br />
						The sound echoing closer.<br />
						Will they come for me next time?</p>
						<p>For every choice, mistake I've made, it's not my plan<br />
						To send you in the arms of another man<br />
						And if you choose to stay I'll wait, I'll understand</p>
						<p>Oh, it's a fragile thing<br />
						This life we lead<br />
						If I think too much I can get overwhelmed by the grace<br />
						By which we live our lives with death over our shoulders</p>
						<p>Want you to know that should I go<br />
						I always loved you, held you high above, true.<br />
						I study your face, and the fear goes away.</p>
						<p>It's a fragile thing, this life we lead.<br />

						<p>Want you to know that should I go,<br />
						I always loved you, held you high above, true.<br />
						I study your face, and the fear goes away,<br />
						The fear goes away,<br />
						The fear goes away,<br />
						The fear goes away.</p>
						<p>Ah-ah, oh-oh<br />
						Ah-ah, oh-oh</p>

					<h3>Did you know?</h3>
					<p>For the epic two-minute solo that closes <cite>Alive</cite>, lead guitarist Mike McCready tried to channel one of his childhood heroes: Kiss ax man Ace Frehley. <q>Ace was their firecracker, their dynamite</q> McCready wrote in <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/" title="Rolling Stone Magazine" target="_blank"><cite>Rolling Stone Magazine</cite></a> in 2014. <q>He's what took them over the top with the feel he put into his leads. I really gravitated towards his vibrato. My lead for <cite>Alive</cite> is based on <cite>She</cite> and that's based on <cite>Five to One</cite> by the Doors.</q></p>
